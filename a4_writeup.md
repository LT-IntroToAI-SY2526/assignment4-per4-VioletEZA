# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part for tic-tac-toe would probably be when I was attempting to write the make_move funtion. I honestly just felt confused on how to go about it. I feel like other than that, the funtions seemed to make sense on how to write them.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
Maybe by creating a database with multiple ways of how to play the game and then importing it to a4.py 
Then like from there it would 

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
